It provides a detailed comparison between the current AS-IS infrastructure hosted locally in Amsterdam and the proposed TO-BE architecture on Azure. Key highlights include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Reduced annual costs from €15,000 to €11,200 by migrating to Azure【4:0†mixtapes.pdf】.\n",
       "- Improved global reach with Azure's multi-region deployments, enhancing user experience with lower latency【4:0†mixtapes.pdf】.\n",
       "- Implementation of advanced features like Azure Kubernetes Service for scalability, Azure Blob Storage for cost-efficient data management, and Azure CDN for fast global delivery【4:6†mixtapes.pdf】【4:15†mixtapes.pdf】.\n",

       "   - *Motivation: To ensure the proposed plan is actionable and measurable with respect to the detailed phases in the case document.*\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **How would you address potential data security and compliance issues during and after the migration process?**\n",
       "   - *Motivation: Addressing concerns about data integrity and security which are crucial for stakeholder confidence, as detailed in the case document.*\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **What specific steps would you recommend for risk mitigation and ensuring uninterrupted service during migration?**\n",
